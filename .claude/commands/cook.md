Use all your agents to proactively process this prd $ARGUMENTS

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, thoroughly analyze the PRD to understand all requirements
2. Create a detailed execution plan breaking down the project into tasks
3. Implement each component systematically using appropriate tools
4. Generate all necessary code, documentation, and configuration
5. Organize deliverables in a clear, professional structure

EXECUTION PROCESS:
- Read and analyze the entire PRD
- List all identified requirements and features
- Create an implementation roadmap
- Generate code artifacts for each component
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Create setup and deployment guides
- Implement testing where applicable
- Provide a complete project summary

DELIVERABLES:
- Full codebase with all required features
- Documentation (README, API docs, inline comments)
- Configuration files
- Test files (if applicable)
- Setup instructions
- Architecture overview
- Implementation notes

APPROACH:
- Assume production-ready code quality
- Follow best practices for the identified tech stack
- Make reasonable assumptions where details are missing
- Document all assumptions clearly
- Optimize for clarity and maintainability

Begin by analyzing the PRD and presenting your execution plan and then using agents to implement plan.
